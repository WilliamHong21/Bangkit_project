Machine Learning Model

# SkinCareku

SkinCareku is an application that can detect facial skin health and provide suitable
treatment or skincare recommendations. This is because many people, not only women but
also men, are becoming more aware of the importance of skin health. The weather
conditions in Indonesia require us to take care of our facial skin to maintain its brightness
and health.

Often there is a mismatch between skincare and skin types, and many people spend a lot
of money trying various skincare products. With our application, we hope to help users
identify their skin issues and obtain suitable skincare recommendations.

## Machine Learning Model

Model to predict facial problems that users have such as acne, comedo, and clear skin.

Model is built using TensorFlow lite for image classification tasks, We use Kaggle as a cloud based machine learning platform to train our machine learning model because easy to use dataset. We'll train a model to classify images of faces as having acne, clear skin, and comedo.
